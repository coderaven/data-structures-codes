###About###
Needless to explain everything, but this is a repository of all my recovered prehistoric good ol' 
Data Structures Source Codes from my 2nd year in college of MUST BSIT.

This repository includes all the corresponding executable for each source and their documentation.
This might be useful as a reference in the future or even just a simple remains of how I code in the past :D
